Homework 08 – Linked List
Problem Description

You will create an implementation of a linked list, one of the fundamental data structures in computer science! Under the hood, your operating system, and countless everyday applications rely upon these.

Solution Description

We highly recommend that you read this entire document in its entirety and familiarize yourself with the requirements of this assignment before writing any code!

Important: All classes created in this assignment should be generic classes. All instances of generic classes should specify a concrete type and should never use raw types or Object. If a method returns a reference type, it must use generic types, and should never use raw types or Object.

A linked list is an ordered sequence of nodes. Each node stores data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. The first node is called the head and a reference to it should be kept. This is the “entry point” to the linked list. When there are no nodes in the list, the head should be null.

Important Notes (Don’t Skip)

Non-compiling files will receive a 0 for all associated rubric items.

Do not submit .class files.

Test your code in addition to the basic checks on Gradescope.

Submit every file each time you resubmit.

Read the “Allowed Imports” and “Restricted Features” to avoid losing points.

Check on Ed Discussion for a note containing all official clarifications and sample outputs.

It is expected that everyone will follow the Student-Faculty Expectations document and the Student Code of Conduct. The professor expects a positive, respectful, and engaged academic environment inside the classroom, outside the classroom, in all electronic communications, on all file submissions, and on any document submitted throughout the duration of the course. No inappropriate language is to be used, and any assignment deemed by the professor to contain inappropriate offensive language or threats will get a zero. You are to use professionalism in your work. Violations of this conduct policy will be turned over to the Office of Student Integrity for misconduct.
